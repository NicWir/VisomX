\usage{
met.normalize(
  mSetObj = NA,
  rowNorm,
  transNorm,
  scaleNorm,
  ref = NULL,
  norm.vec = NULL,
  ratio = FALSE,
  ratioNum = 20
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mSetObj}{Input name of the created mSet object (see \code{\link[VisomX]{met.read_data}}).}

\item{rowNorm}{(Character) Select the option for row-wise normalization, "QuantileNorm" for Quantile Normalization, "CompNorm" for Normalization by a reference feature, "SumNorm" for Normalization to constant sum of intensities, "MedianNorm" for normalization to sample median, and "SpecNorm" for Normalization by a sample-specific factor.}

\item{transNorm}{(Character) Select option to transform the data, "LogNorm" for Log Normalization, and "CrNorm" for Cubic Root Transformation.}

\item{scaleNorm}{(Character) Select option for scaling the data, "MeanCenter" for Mean Centering, "AutoNorm" for Autoscaling, "ParetoNorm" for Pareto Scaling, amd "RangeNorm" for Range Scaling.}
}
\value{
The input mSet object with imputed data at mSetObj$dataSet$data_proc.
}
\description{
This function performs row-wise normalization, transformation, and scaling of metabolomics data. This step is performed as part of the \code{\link[VisomX]{met.workflow}} function. Additionally, the workflow \code{\link[VisomX]{met.test_normalization}} allows the simultaneous testing of different data processing conditions and helps with finding the most suitable options.
