# Introduction

The aim of this `VisomX`'s proteomics section is to provide an
integrated analysis workflow for robust and reproducible analysis of
mass spectrometry proteomics data for differential protein expression or
differential enrichment. This section is build on the foundation of the
R package `DEP` [@zhang2018]. `VisomX` was designed to be usable with
minimal prior knowledge of the R programming language or programming in
general. You will need to be familiar with the idea of running commands
from a console or writing basic scripts. For R beginners,
[this](https://moderndive.netlify.app/1-getting-started.html) is a great
starting point, there are some good resources
[here](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/) and we suggest
using the [RStudio
application](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/). It
provides an environment for writing and running R code.

With consideration for `R` novices, `VisomX` establishes a framework in
which a complete, detailed proteomics data analysis can be performed in
two simple steps:

1.  *Read data* from a tabular input with protein abundances, as
    generated by quantitative analysis software of raw mass spectrometry
    data

2.  *Run workflow*, including missing value imputation, normalization,
    log2 transformation, statistical analysis, differential expression
    analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, and rendering of a report
    that summarizes the results.

All computational results of a workflow are stored in a data container
(list) and can be visualized by passing them to a set of dedicated
plotting functions.

# Installation

Install the most current version with package `devtools`:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

install_github("NicWir/VisomX")
```

# The test dataset

The proteomics test dataset was generated by culturing *Pseudomonas
putida* KT2440 in 500-mL shaken flasks filled with 50 mL media at 30°C
and 250 rpm. The media were either synthetic de Bont medium supplemented
with 20 mM glucose or 30 mM acetate, or LB medium. Samples were taken in
the mid-exponential phase, and cells were harvested by centrifugation at
17,000 x g for 2 min at 4°C. After removal of the supernatant, cell
pellets were frozen and kept at −80°C until proteomics analysis was
performed as described previously [@rennig2019]. No normalization of
protein abundances was performed prior to this analysis.

The dataset can be loaded via

``` r
dataset <- system.file("prot_KT2440_glc_ac_LB.txt", package = "VisomX")
```
