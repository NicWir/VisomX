Description: This package represents a comprehensive suite of functions
    for robust and reproducible analysis of various omics data. It
    includes popular packages for Omics for data processing,
    normalization, statistical analysis, pattern enrichment analysis and
    visualization (metabomics: MetaboAnalystR, proteomics: DEP, fluxomics
    data visualization: fluctuator). VisomX includes all the original
    features, but adds user-friendly wrapper functions that allow complete
    data analysis workflows to be executed in a single step. The results
    of these workflows are summarized in detailed reports as well as in R
    data containers that can be intuitively navigated.
