Description: This package represents a comprehensive suite of functions for in-depth analysis of various omics data. It includes popular packages for Omics for data processing, normalization, statistical analysis, pattern enrichment analysis and visualization (metabomics: MetaboAnalystR, proteomics: DEP, fluxomics data visualization: fluctuator). VisomX includes all the original features, but adds user-friendly wrapper functions that allow complete data analysis workflows to be executed in a single step. The results of these workflows are summarized in detailed reports as well as in R data containers that can be intuitively navigated.
